# atbs-clipboard-project 
A simple program that allows the user to quickly copy predefined messages.

### How to use it properly:
You can execute it via terminal by python mclip.py [keyphrase], where each keyphrase is linked to a specific message to be copied to clipboard.
**For example:** python mclip.py together will copy <i>Rick Astley's</i> famous hit song <i>Together Forever</i> to your clipboard.
You can set new keyphrases by editing the mclip.py file and adding the new messages to the ANSWERS dictionary.
